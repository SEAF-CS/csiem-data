# CSIEM environmental data management repository



The goal of the CSIEM environmental data management system, as presented herein, is to allow compatibility, inter-operability and between crticial data assets, and version control as is required for the development of a comprehensive and integrated modelling platform.

The framework can be viewed as three separate systems:

- Data Collation
- Data Governance & Reporting
- Data Integration

The relationship between the various data providers, the CSIEM environmental data framework, and downstream model applications are outlined schematically below.

## Data Collation

The aim of the data collation step is to bring data together in a co-ordinated way. Data that is sourced and collated from various government agencies, researchers and industry groups is stored in a “data lake” in their raw format. Each data provider is assigned a unique agency identifier, and datasets are also grouped based on the main programs or iniatives the collection was associated with. Raw data is stored in a rigid folder structure based on these two identifiers :

```
Agency/Program/ < ... data-sets ...>
```
