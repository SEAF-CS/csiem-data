# CSIEM environmental data management repository

The goal of the CSIEM environmental data management system, as presented herein, is to allow compatibility, and inter-operability, between crticial data assets, needed for the operation of the comprehensive integrated modelling platform.

A total of 165Gb of environmental data has been compiled for use in environmental assessment of Cockburn Sound.

The goal of the CSIEM environmental data management repository, as presented herein, is to allow compatibility, inter-operability and comparison of these critical data assets. Version control and data governance is required to ensure a comprehensive and integrated modelling platform.

## Structure of the data repository

This data repository is based around the following structure:

```
csiem-data/
171M    ./code
18M     ./data-governance
31M     ./data-mapping
165M    ./summary-images
98G     ./data-lake          ! Raw data not included in this GitHub repository : see access for further information. 
65G     ./data-warehouse.    ! Ingested (standardised) data not included in this repository : see access for further information. 
TOTAL = 165G
