### Import Code
This code loops over the columns of the excel spreadsheet matching the variable names, then iterates over the two sites and determines which site is currently being processed.

## Seagrass
    This dataset is imported by import_theme2_seagrass.m
    
### Issues
    No dedicated Sheet for this agency in the variable key. The variables exist in the master key, but aren't being searched for and have each been hard coded. 

### Variables
    Variables taken from comments in code:
 - var00324	Posidonia Sinuosa Count
 - var00325	Posidonia Sinuosa Density
 - var00326	Posidonia Sinuosa Above Ground Biomass
 - var00327	Posidonia Sinuosa Below Ground Biomass
 - var00351	Posidonia Sinuosa Total Biomass
  
## SG PAR
This is from wamsi theme 2 the seagrass restoration, this is specifically the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) portion of the dataset.

### Code
This dataset is imported by "import_theme2_SG_PAR.m". This dataset is split up into a different csv file for each site, so the code iterates through the csv files, The code determines the current site and then iterates over the PAR variables. It creates a datafile and a header file for each unique site and variable pair and fills in any meta data required.
